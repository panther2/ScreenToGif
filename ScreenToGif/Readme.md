# ScreenToGif  

This is the current project of ScreenToGif.  

_VS 2017 and .Net 4.6.1 or newer required._


## Version 2.8.1:

• German and Portuguese translations got updated.  
• Several improvements to the "key presses" feature, including the removal of repeating key presses ("bbbb" will appear as "b") and a better treatment of modifier keys.

Fixed:

♦ The mouse click detector was updating the state of the click only after moving the mouse.  
♦ The task to automatically remove old projects was not working properly.  
♦ The recorder was detecting it self when the "snap to window" action was activated.  

Known Bugs:

♠ The Insert window does not respect the image DPI.
